title: Compensation
---

While I do not accept any compensation from bitcoin companies in connection with this project, the following companies have sent me their hardware devices for free to play with:

* Trezor
* Coldcard
* Keystone (formerly Cobo Vault)
* Specter DIY (parts)

Note that I have written bitcoin wallet software for a number of companies in the space since 2013, though none of them are involved in the hardware wallet space.

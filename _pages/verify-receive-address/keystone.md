title: Verify Receive Address on Keystone (formerly Cobo Vault)
---

Verifying receive addresses is one area where the Keystone wallet excels!
The large screen and true airgap improve both security and useability.

On Keystone, click `Multisig Wallet` > `Receiving` tab (default selected) and click on the address:  
![](/assets/img/verify-receive-address-keystone.jpeg){:width="35%" class="border_image"} 

To see more addresses, return to the `Receiving` tab, and press the big `+` button to add more addresses
